# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #3: Building Your First Full-stack Application

### Overview

For your 3rd project, you will be building an application using the 
MERN stack. ​ Use your imagination! You get to create whatever you want for this app. 
Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough 
programming challenges.

You'll need to run your user stories, wireframes, and database design by your 
instructors to get their feedback and approval before you begin coding! Remember 
to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope 
creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

Identify what you need to build and accomplish to meet project expectations and 
identify everything else as stretch goals. If you meet your MVP (Minimum Viable 
Product) ahead of schedule, you can decide which reach goals to focus on for the 
remainder of your time.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 3 models** (more if they make sense) – one representing someone using your application (a user), and two that represent the main functional ideas for your app
* **Use React as a front-end framework**
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* **Write Mongo queries using the Mongoose module** and interact with your document database. Promises will likely make your life easier as you start to build complex queries!
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
* **Include User Stories**
* **Include ERDs**
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* Have at least **100 lines of CSS** (not including whitespace)
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public via Heroku

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted on Heroku
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and 
frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, 
commit often.
* **A ``README.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach 
was taken, unsolved problems, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your 
project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your README
* A link in your ``README.md`` to the publicly-accessible **user stories you created**

Most importantly a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

* Is 5 minutes in length
* Shows off all features of the app
* Explains the technical details
* Explains the technical challenges
* Explains which improvements you might make

Github `readme.md` files are written in a language called Markdown which is compiled into HTML. You'll be using this a lot so it's good to learn some simple syntax rules now.

### To Submit

* Submit your project to Schoology by the time indicated on the class schedule.

### Useful Resources

* **[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com)** _(for hosting your back-end)_
* **[Writing Good User Stories](http://www.mariaemerson.com/user-stories/)** _(for a few user story tips)_
* **[Presenting Information Architecture](http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/3-information-architecture/4-presenting-information.html)** _(for more insight into wireframing)_

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Deployment and Functionality__: Is your application deployed and functional at a public URL? Is your application free of errors and incomplete functionality?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

# Project Week

## Attendance
You are required to be present by 10:00 am EDT each day during the project.

## Standups
We will have student-run stand-ups each morning at 10:15 am EDT where you will answer the following questions:

- What did I work on yesterday
- What am i trying to get done today
- What is preventing me from getting this done.

This meeting should take no longer than 15 minutes.

If you have ideas on how you can help a fellow-student with work that they are stuck on, please follow-up with information AFTER the stand up.

## Where to go for help during project week
1. Seek out help online
2. Seek out help with your classmates
3. Seek out the help of instructors and TAs

## How to ask for help

1. **WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SOLVE:**
  - Be able to give a thorough explanation of the feature or user story you're working on.

2. **DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUG/ERROR:**
  - A detailed description of the problem, the bug, and/or the error. This means: the full steps to reproduce and references to the line number of where the relavent code is.

3. **WHAT I'VE TRIED**
  - List everything you've done to solve the bug on your own in detail. List all resources you've looked up and tried to implement and provide links. 

4. **QUESTION**
  - After going through all this what is your questions specifically, more specifically than how can I make this work?

## Plagiarism Review

### Statement

General Assembly takes academic honesty very seriously, and as such will not tolerate any student who plagiarizes in order to satisfy class requirements.  Programs at General Assembly are intensive, require a lot of work on the part of the student, and students will occasionally not be able to complete work in a timely fashion.

Rather than rely on work that’s not your own to create the appearance of success, let your instructional team know as early as possible that you are not prepared for the work.  It is much easier to come up with a plan, than it is to succeed if you’ve been removed from the program.

### Definition

Plagiarism is the act of claiming that work that does not belong to you is in fact your own.  It can take many forms, and each concentration at General Assembly will have a slightly different guideline to identify plagiarism in their field.

Generally it is safe to assume that if you are including work that does not belong to you in an effort to build on your own work — cite it.  If you are using work that does not belong to you as a replacement for your own work, you’re probably plagiarizing.

Plagiarism can unintentionally occur.  While it is fine to use outside sources, if **all** or **most** of your code (specifically logic/JS/Ruby) is from other git repos/videos/blog posts, you are in violation of the plagiarism rules cited above.  If you do use outside resources, make sure you **cite** those resources in your README.md file.

### Procedure

If an instructor is in doubt of a students work or has evidence of plagiarism, the student will be asked to justify the work they've submitted. This often is in the context of making you explain your code line by line. Should they be unable to show the work they have claimed as their own is in fact theirs, the student will face disciplinary action.

Instances of plagiarism will be evaluated on a case by case basis, but will most likely result in removal from the program
